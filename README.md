# Full-stack-Course Project

Welcome to my Full-stack-Course project! Follow these instructions to get the project up and running.

The Project has been tested and run on node v18.18.2 (64-bit) and node v20.10.0 (64-bit).

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/EricLUT20/Full-stack-Course-Project.git
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Full-stack-Course-Project

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Project
    ```

4. Install Dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Start the server using npm:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start on `localhost:3000`.

In this project I used MongoDB and the connection will be established at `mongodb://localhost:27017/meanauth` 

Hopefully, the project runs as expected!
